# Console-Against-Humanity
Play Cards Against Humanity (alone) in your Python console.
My first running Python program that's a very basic MVP for a larger project where I'll take quotes from my favorite shows and build my own multiplayer CAH server. Apparently creating CAH clones and card game engines in general is a great way to learn programming, and I'm not the only one to think so as there are a handful of Python implementations of CAH on GitHub alone.

Anyway this is obivously comparatively much more basic projct. Users can set the number of turns, manage a persistent hand, see their choosen white cards in context within each prompt/black card, and play again. Cards are loaded in through a JSON in the directory. The current one contains five packs of about 34 black cards and 52 white cards, mostly centered around sci-fi and fantasy. The JSON can absolutely be replaced, so long as it follows the format of [JSON Against Humanity by Chris Hallberg (crhallberg)](https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity). You can export packs of cards directly from Chris's website: https://crhallberg.com/cah/
